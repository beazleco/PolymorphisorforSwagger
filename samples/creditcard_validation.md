Level: **lenient**

12 operation sheets, **11 would generate**, **1 would fail**. 1 support sheet skipped.

1 error, 20 warnings.

## Endpoints that would fail

Each of these needs a correction in the workbook before a specification can be generated for it.

### Card Issued Device_Retrieve

- **S001 at Card Issued Device_Retrieve!A7**
  - Found: this sheet has no Request Body section. The only request section is 'Request Header' at row 7, and the rows beneath it carry the request schema, so the label is wrong
  - Expected: a section labelled Request Body holding the request schema
  - Fix: change 'Request Header' in cell A7 to Request Body. If the sheet genuinely describes request headers, add a separate Request Body section for the schema.

## Warnings

| Code | Where | Found | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| T002 | `Available Funds_Retrieve!G10` | 'issuedDeviceIdentificationType' has no Data Type and no nested rows, so it was treated as a string | set the Data Type of 'issuedDeviceIdentificationType', for example String (35) or Number(12) |
| T002 | `Available Funds_Retrieve!G19` | 'partyIdentificationType' has no Data Type and no nested rows, so it was treated as a string | set the Data Type of 'partyIdentificationType', for example String (35) or Number(12) |
| T002 | `Available Funds_Retrieve!G27` | 'primaryCardTag' has no Data Type and no nested rows, so it was treated as a string | set the Data Type of 'primaryCardTag', for example String (35) or Number(12) |
| G001 | `Available Funds_Retrieve` | the sheet name implies GET but the Request Body section declares a schema, and GET cannot carry a body, so the operation was emitted as POST | confirm POST for this operation, or move the request attributes into a Request Parameter section so they become query parameters |
| T002 | `Transaction Adjustment_Initiate!H50` | 'authenticationMethodType' has no Data Type and no nested rows, so it was treated as a string | set the Data Type of 'authenticationMethodType', for example String (35) or Number(12) |
| G001 | `Recency Check_Retrieve` | the sheet name implies GET but the Request Body section declares a schema, and GET cannot carry a body, so the operation was emitted as POST | confirm POST for this operation, or move the request attributes into a Request Parameter section so they become query parameters |
| G001 | `Account Statement_Retrieve` | the sheet name implies GET but the Request Body section declares a schema, and GET cannot carry a body, so the operation was emitted as POST | confirm POST for this operation, or move the request attributes into a Request Parameter section so they become query parameters |
| V003 | `Card Transaction_Retrieve!L1` | variant 02 'Authorization Transactions' was paired with SOR column 'SOR v1/account/search/auth' by position, but the two names have nothing in common | reorder the SOR columns to match the order of the requestVariant values, or reword one of them so the pairing is obvious |
| V003 | `Card Transaction_Retrieve!M1` | variant 03 'Installment Transactions' was paired with SOR column 'SOR /v1/account/search/mps' by position, but the two names have nothing in common | reorder the SOR columns to match the order of the requestVariant values, or reword one of them so the pairing is obvious |
| G001 | `Card Transaction_Retrieve` | the sheet name implies GET but the Request Body section declares a schema, and GET cannot carry a body, so the operation was emitted as POST | confirm POST for this operation, or move the request attributes into a Request Parameter section so they become query parameters |
| A006 | `Card Details_Retrieve!I53` | 'AvailabilityType' is declared object but has no nested rows beneath it | add the attributes of 'AvailabilityType' one Level deeper, or change its Data Type to a scalar |
| A006 | `Card Details_Retrieve!I59` | 'AddressLine' is declared object but has no nested rows beneath it | add the attributes of 'AddressLine' one Level deeper, or change its Data Type to a scalar |
| A006 | `Card Details_Retrieve!I71` | 'Country' is declared object but has no nested rows beneath it | add the attributes of 'Country' one Level deeper, or change its Data Type to a scalar |
| V003 | `Card Details_Retrieve!L1` | variant 02 'Accunt Deliquency' was paired with SOR column 'SOR /v1/account/delinquency' by position, but the two names have nothing in common | reorder the SOR columns to match the order of the requestVariant values, or reword one of them so the pairing is obvious |
| G001 | `Card Details_Retrieve` | the sheet name implies GET but the Request Body section declares a schema, and GET cannot carry a body, so the operation was emitted as POST | confirm POST for this operation, or move the request attributes into a Request Parameter section so they become query parameters |
| T002 | `Card Issued Device_Retrieve!H28` | 'partyIdentificationMasked' has no Data Type and no nested rows, so it was treated as a string | set the Data Type of 'partyIdentificationMasked', for example String (35) or Number(12) |
| V001 | `Card Issued Device_Retrieve!I1` | this sheet has 3 SOR columns but the request declares no requestVariant values | add requestVariant to the request and list one numbered variant per SOR column, or confirm that the variant is chosen by which identifier the caller supplies |
| G001 | `Customer Addl Data` | the sheet name implies GET but the Request Body section declares a schema, and GET cannot carry a body, so the operation was emitted as POST | confirm POST for this operation, or move the request attributes into a Request Parameter section so they become query parameters |
| E001 | `Card RSAEncrypted!H17` | the Response Body section declares 3 attributes and not one of them names an SOR field, so no payload was published for it | fill in the SOR column for the attributes this message carries. If it carries none, delete the rows and leave the Response Body label in place. |
| G001 | `Card RSAEncrypted` | the sheet name implies GET but the Request Body section declares a schema, and GET cannot carry a body, so the operation was emitted as POST | confirm POST for this operation, or move the request attributes into a Request Parameter section so they become query parameters |
